# Bastion instance

This Terraform solution deploys a Bastion instance that serves as a secure jump host for your infrastructure. 
It improves the security by minimizing the use of Public IPs and limiting access to the rest of the environment. 

Also create a Service Account with generated Auhorization key pair to authentificate Nebius CLI on the host.

Also installed on the host:
- Wireguard VPN solution with UI
- Nebius CLI and configured with profile authentificated by Service account
- kubectl and configured to connect to first mk8s cluster available in project by --internal flag
  (scanned by: `nebius mk8s v1 cluster list`)

## How to connect over bastion

### Edit you local ssh config

`~/.ssh/config`

```
Host bastion
    HostName <public_ip_of_bastion_host>
    User bastion
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private.key

Host target
    HostName <private_ip_of_host_after_bastion>
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private.key
    ProxyJump bastion
```

### Login to remote VM behind bastion
```
ssh target
```

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Nebius CLI](https://docs.nebius.dev/en/cli/#installation):
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://storage.eu-north1.nebius.cloud/cli/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Reload your shell session:

   ```bash
   exec -l $SHELL
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. [Configure](https://docs.nebius.ai/cli/configure/) Nebius CLI (we recommend using [service account](https://docs.nebius.ai/iam/service-accounts/manage/)):
   ```bash
   nebius init
   ```

4. Install JQuery (for Debian-based distributions):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install jq -y
   ```

## Installation

To deploy the solution, follow these steps:

1. Load environment variables:
   ```bash
   source ./environment.sh
   ```
2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
3. Replace the placeholder content in `terraform.tfvars` with the configuration values that you need. See the details [below](#configuration-variables).
4. Preview the deployment plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
5. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   Wait for the operation to complete.

## Configuration variables

Update the following variables in the `terraform.tfvars` file with your own values:

- `tenant-id`
- `parent_id`
- `subnet_id`
- `ssh_user_name`
- `ssh_public_key`

## Creating and using a public IP allocation

This step allows you to retain the IP address even if the VM is deleted. If you donâ€™t need to keep the IP adress, skip section.

1. Create a public IP allocation:
   ```bash
   nebius vpc v1 allocation create  --ipv-4-public \
   --parent-id <project-id> --name wireguard_allocation_pub \
   --format json | jq -r '.metadata.id'
   ```
2. Assign the value from the previous step to the `public_ip_allocation_id` variable in [variables.tf](./variables.tf):

```bash
public_ip_allocation_id = <public_ip_allocation_id>
```

### Logging into Wireguard UI

1. SSH into the Wireguard instance:
   ```bash
   ssh -i <path_to_private_ssh_key> <ssh_user_name>@<instance_public_ip>
   ```

2. Retrieve the Wireguard UI password:
   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/lib/wireguard-ui/initial_password
   ```

3. Open the Wireguard UI in your browser:
   ```
   http://<instance_public_ip>:5000
   ```

4. Log in with the following credentials:
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** [password retrieved in step 2]

### Notes

- **Apply Config:** After creating, deleting or changing Wireguard users, select "Apply Config".
- **Allowed IPs:** When adding new users, specify the CIDRs of your existing infrastructure in the "Allowed IPs" field.
